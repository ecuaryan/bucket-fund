# Credit cards as liabilities — design

**Status: shipped** (migration `79`; stages 1–3 landed together in one PR,
docs in the same PR). Remaining follow-up: refresh PWA screenshots + demo
GIF (hero copy changed).

**Sign convention: verified.** Per Teller, an outstanding credit card
balance comes back as a **positive** number in the ledger balance —
matching the code's assumption (positive = owed; we store `balance.ledger`
raw and subtract). Note: sandbox credit-card fixtures always report a
$0.00 balance, so exercising the subtraction in dev means a manual card —
same code paths, `is_credit_card_account_type` ignores `source`.

## Why

The app's promise is "log in and see where your daily money really is."
For a household that spends on a credit card, cash alone overstates that:
$3,000 in checking with $1,200 on the card is $1,800 of daily money. The
hero number must bake the liability in or it means less.

## The model

One equation, invariant preserved:

```
cash − credit card balances = bucket allocations + Unbucketed
```

- **Card spending behaves like debit spending.** A swipe raises card debt →
  Unbucketed dips → the user covers it from a bucket. Same discipline,
  same red-signal semantics as today.
- **Paying the statement is net zero.** Cash drops, debt drops equally —
  Unbucketed doesn't move, because the spending was covered when it happened.
- **Red Unbucketed keeps its one meaning:** spending (cash or card) not yet
  covered by a bucket. No second alarm (see AGENTS.md ledger bullet).
- **Truth over comfort.** Linking a card with existing debt drops Unbucketed
  by that amount immediately — possibly deep red. That is the point. One
  consequential confirm sheet at link time (existing app convention), then
  no further ceremony. No special "carried debt" machinery; a user who wants
  to pay debt down over time creates an ordinary payoff bucket.

## Decided scope (2026-07)

| Decision | Choice |
| -------- | ------ |
| Liability types | **Credit cards only** (`credit_card` type/subtype). Loans, mortgages, lines of credit stay excluded — not daily-money vehicles. |
| Manual cards | **In v1.** Households at banks Teller doesn't support can add a self-reported card balance, mirroring manual money sources. |
| On-link moment | **One confirm sheet, then truth.** Sheet states the card's balance and that Unbucketed drops by it immediately. |
| Kids | **Household only.** Cards cannot be assigned to a kid; the assign-to-kid flow excludes card accounts. Kid balance math is untouched. |
| Which balance | Teller's current/ledger balance as reported ("we're subject to what Teller reports"). Sign conventions verified against real payloads in stage 1. |

## Mechanics by layer

### Schema / SQL

- New `public.is_credit_card_account_type(text)` beside
  `is_cash_account_type` (client mirror in `src/lib/accounts.ts` and
  `supabase/functions/_shared/cashAccountTypes.ts`).
- `member_float()` (adult branch) subtracts the family's card balances;
  child branches unchanged (kids can't hold cards).
- Balance-breakdown function (migration `67` lineage) gains a
  `card_debt` field so the hero breakdown can render the subtract line.
- Manual cards: extend `add_manual_account` / `update_manual_account`
  (migration `31`) with a card kind — stored in `accounts` with
  `source = 'manual'`, `account_type = 'credit_card'`.
- Store card balances with a normalized sign (debt is positive in
  `current_balance`; the subtraction happens in the ledger functions) so
  one convention holds for Teller and manual rows.

### Edge Functions

- `teller-enroll`: keep persisting card accounts (already happens);
  return enough data for the on-link confirm sheet.
- `teller-refresh` / `teller-webhook`: stop skipping non-cash accounts
  **for cards** — card balances must stay current or the equation lies.
  Other non-cash types remain skipped.

### Client

- `availableBalance.ts`: subtract card balances next to `sumCashBalance`.
- `floatBreakdown.ts`: new `kind: 'subtract'` line — the structure
  already supports it (see "Allocated to buckets" / "Set aside for kids").
- FloatHero: number is net automatically once `member_float` changes;
  subtext gains card context (see Copy).
- Admin: card rows get a "counts against your balance" note; the
  assign-to-kid select excludes cards; manual-card add/edit forms.
- Bank tab: card section with current balance and activity.
- Move/give dialogs, Auto-bucket: **no mechanical changes** — they read
  Unbucketed via the same functions and already tolerate negative values
  with the existing confirm sheet.

### Explicitly unchanged

`move_money` / `give_money` guards, bucket rules, kid balance math,
History snapshots (they record Unbucketed, which is simply net now).

## Edge cases

- **Interest and fees** raise debt with no purchase — Unbucketed dips and
  the hint copy must say card balances count against it, so the dip is
  explainable. It is just more spending to cover.
- **Partial linking** (card linked, paying checking account not linked, or
  vice versa): payment netting breaks and the number skews. v1 answer:
  document it and note it in the linked-accounts intro copy; no blocking.
  We show the truth across what's linked.
- **Refunds/credits** can produce a negative card balance (bank owes you);
  that adds to Unbucketed under the same equation — correct, no special case
  for linked cards. **Manual cards clamp at $0** (the RPC rejects negative
  amounts and the form can't enter them) — enter 0 if the bank owes you;
  simplicity over a rarely-used negative-entry UI.

## Staged plan (shipped as one PR)

1. **Sync + classification.** `is_credit_card_account_type` (SQL + TS +
   Deno mirror), card refresh in `teller-refresh`/webhook, sign
   normalization verified against real Teller payloads. No user-visible
   change.
2. **The equation.** `member_float()` + breakdown `card_debt` + client
   subtraction + hero/breakdown/hint copy + on-link confirm sheet.
   `tests/db` extended (see below). This is the PR where the green number
   changes meaning.
3. **Manual cards.** RPC extension + Admin forms + copy.
4. **Docs + assets.** Narrative updates across docs (inventory below),
   PWA screenshots + demo GIF (hero changed).

Test plan (stage 2): `tests/db/` cases for float-with-card-debt, payment
netting (cash −X, debt −X → float unchanged), card-only family, negative
card balance, kid exclusion; unit tests for `availableBalance`,
`floatBreakdown`, and the new copy helpers.

## Copy inventory (`src/lib/brand.ts`)

| Surface | Constant | Change |
| ------- | -------- | ------ |
| Hero subtitle | `FLOAT_HERO_SUBTITLE` ("Left over after buckets") | Reword to include cards, e.g. "Left over after buckets and cards" |
| Negative hint | `FLOAT_NEGATIVE_HINT` ("You've bucketed more than you have.") | Reword — red now also means uncovered card spending |
| Breakdown line | new `BREAKDOWN_CARD_DEBT_LABEL` | "Credit cards" subtract line |
| On-link confirm | new `LINK_CARD_CONFIRM_TITLE` / `_BODY` | States balance and immediate Unbucketed drop |
| Admin card rows | new card note string; `ADMIN_LINKED_ACCOUNTS_INTRO` | Add one clause: card balances count against the household balance |
| Manual cards | new `ADMIN_MANUAL_CARD_*` strings | Add/edit/delete forms and hints |
| Bank tab | new card section label | — |

`BANK_READ_ONLY_ASSURANCE` is unchanged — read-only applies to cards too.

## Documentation inventory (stage 4)

- **CONTEXT.md** — replace the credit-cards TODO with the decision;
  rewrite the balance-model/invariant sections to the new equation;
  update Data Integrity and the architecture notes.
- **docs/BRAND.md** — the word-for-word product narrative gains the
  liability clause; copy map gains the new constants.
- **AGENTS.md** — "The ledger identity is the contract" bullet gets the
  new equation; the red-Unbucketed signal description updated.
- **README.md** — pitch line ("reconciles to the real bank balance")
  and implementation status.
- **docs/MAINTENANCE.md** — drop the credit-cards bullet from Deferred;
  refresh screenshots/GIF (hero changes).
- **This doc** — update Status as stages ship.
